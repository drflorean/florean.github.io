title: About myself

---

Originally from a city just on the side of Milano, Italy, I moved to Germany in 2017 to pursue a double degree Master program.
I obtained my Master degree and my Doctoral degree from the universities of Bamberg and HU Berlin, respectively.\
Now I live in the north of Bayern with my partner and two cats.\
\
In my free time, I volunteer at a bike co-op and enjoy riding my bikes (plural) in the beautiful hills around my home.
