I have a strong quantitative approach and a strong training in quantitative analysis methods, but I highly value qualitative insights.\nI worked on family formation dynamics, marriage, partnership patterns and transition to parenthood.\nI am interested in anything related to social inequalities, life course development, structural change and a little bit of historical demography. I am also more and more interested in science communicaiton and data visualization.\nFor more information about my past and current research, see my portfolio."
