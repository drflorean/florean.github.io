    "text": "I am a sociologist and demographer by training. I have a strong quantitative approach and a strong training in quantitative analysis methods, but I highly value qualitative insights.\nI worked on family formation dynamics, marriage, partnership patterns and transition to parenthood.\nI am interested in anything related to social inequalities, life course development, structural change and a little bit of historical demography. I am also more and more interested in science communication and data visualization.\nFor more information about my past and current research, see my portfolio."

    "text": "Originally from a city just on the side of Milano, Italy, I initially studied Economics, obtaining a Bachelor’s Degree from Bocconi University. As I developed an interest in demography and sociology, I enrolled in a Master’s degree in Sociology and Social Research at the University of Trento (Italy).\nI moved to Germany in 2017 to pursue a double degree Master program, and never left. I obtained my Master degree in 2019 and my Doctoral degree in 2023 from the universities of Bamberg and HU Berlin, respectively.\nNow I live in the north of Bayern in a beautiful historical town, with my partner and two cats.\n\nIn my free time, I volunteer at a local bike co-op and enjoy riding my bikes (plural) in the beautiful hills around my home.\ndownload my CV here\nLebenslauf herunterladen"
